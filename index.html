        Zimbabwe is a very green country with lots of natural attractions and
        wildlife. Its map happens to surround an achean craton. In geology this
        means a particularly old and thick piece of continental crust which is
        usually rich in minerals. The country has an abundance of most known
        minerals which are under explored due to less developed mining
        technology. This is a particularly interesting fact to me as I have a
        background in geology.
